            <p>This tutorial will tell you the easiest way to hide apps on your Android phone.</p>

            <p>Bonus: You can also hide your private photos, videos, music and other files too.</p>

            <p>Best of all this method is completely free, no caveats or hidden fees. It is mind boggling how this
                amazing app is
                completely free</p>

            <h2 id="step1">Step 1</h2>

            <p>Download <a href="http://hideitpro.com/">Hide it Pro app</a></p>

            <p>Playstore Link: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hideitpro" />https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hideitpro</a></p>

            <h2 id="step2">Step 2</h2>

            <p>Open the app. You will be presented with a screen to change audio volumes. Now you might think, did
                I download a
                wrong app. No, the app actually looks like a Audio Manager but in essence this screen is just to
                throw off people
                snooping in your phone.</p>

            <p>Tap and hold on the Audio Manager logo to actually enter the app.</p>

            <h2 id="step3">Step 3</h2>

            <p>On the next screen setup your desired password and continue</p>

            <h2 id="step4">Step 4</h2>

            <p>Now inside the Dashboard or Vault screen, you'll be shown a number of icons which allow you to hide
                your photos,
                videos, music, notes, and APPS</p>

            <h2 id="step5">Step 5</h2>

            <p>Tap on Hide Apps icon and you'll be shown a screen, where you can add an app to hide it from your
                home screen</p>

            <h2 id="step6">Step 6</h2>
